A game of snake for the arduino mega 2560. 

Once loaded the game runs forever. Controls to the snake are provided through physical switches in a breadboard.

Each "pixel" is controlled through three separate wires that determine the color. Because only one line can be changed at a time manual refreshing in software is necessary.
